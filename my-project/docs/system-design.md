# System Design — Olympiad Portal

> **Team:** Prompt Engineers
> **Version:** 1.0
> **Last updated:** September 2026

## 1. Architecture

The Olympiad Portal uses a **multi-tier architecture** with three tiers deployed on separate managed services:

```
CLIENT TIER                    APPLICATION TIER               DATA TIER
React SPA (Vercel CDN)   --->  Express API (Render)   --->   PostgreSQL (Supabase)
Role-based dashboards          Routes > Controllers          Prisma ORM
React Router, React Query      > Services > Prisma           Supabase Auth
                               Helmet, CORS, WebSocket       Supabase Storage
```

### Why Multi-Tier

- **Separation of concerns:** Each tier handles one responsibility (presentation, business logic, data storage)
- **Independent scaling:** Frontend serves from CDN; backend scales horizontally on Render; database scales vertically on Supabase
- **Security boundaries:** The client never accesses the database directly; all data flows through the API tier which enforces authentication and authorisation

For the rationale behind each individual technology choice, see [Architecture](architecture.md), [Frontend](frontend.md), [Backend](backend.md), and [Data and Storage](data-storage.md).

## 2. Backend Architecture

### Request Lifecycle

```
HTTP Request
  > Helmet (security headers)
  > CORS (origin validation)
  > Body parsing (JSON / URL-encoded)
  > Route matching
  > requireAuth middleware (validates Supabase JWT)
  > requireRole middleware (checks role: organiser/educator/student)
  > express-validator middleware (validates request body/params)
  > Controller (HTTP concerns)
  > Service (business logic)
  > Prisma ORM (database queries)
  > JSON Response
  > errorHandler (catches all errors, maps to HTTP status codes)
```

### Error Handling

Custom error hierarchy maps to HTTP status codes:

| Error Class     | Status | Use case                                   |
| --------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| BadRequest      | 400    | Invalid input                              |
| Unauthorized    | 401    | Missing or expired JWT                     |
| Forbidden       | 403    | Insufficient role                          |
| NotFound        | 404    | Resource does not exist                    |
| Conflict        | 409    | Unique constraint violation (Prisma P2002) |
| ValidationError | 422    | Failed express-validator rules             |

All errors return `{ success: false, error: "message" }`. Stack traces are suppressed in production.

### API Routes

Routes are grouped by resource: auth/registration, olympiads, rounds, notification rules, questions, exam approval, papers, submissions, marking, and the student portal/exam-sitting flow. Access is restricted by role (public, any authenticated user, organiser, or educator) via the `requireAuth`/`requireRole` middleware described above.

The full, current list of endpoints with request/response shapes lives in one place to avoid drift: see the [API Reference](api.md).

| submission_status | received, automarked, queued_for_marking, marked, moderated |

### Design Decisions

- **UUIDs** for all primary keys — prevents enumeration, safe in URLs
- **Soft delete** on users (deleted_at column) — preserves referential integrity
- **timestamptz(6)** on all timestamps — timezone-aware precision for deadlines
- **Composite unique constraints** — submissions(round_id, entrant_id, route) prevents duplicates; entrant_registrations(entrant_id, round_id) prevents double registration
- **Indexes** — rounds(state, opens_at, closes_at) for lifecycle queries; results(round_id, rank) for leaderboards
- **Idempotency key** on submissions — prevents double-submission on network retries

## 4. Core Behaviours

### Authentication Flow

1. **Organiser self-registration:** POST /auth/register/organiser with organiser_secret environment variable, creates Supabase Auth user and users row with role=organiser
2. **School invitation:** Organiser creates school, generates SCH-XXXX-XXXX code, emails school contact
3. **Educator registration:** Educator visits /signup, enters code, verifies school details, creates account linked to school
4. **Student registration:** Educator bulk-generates codes, each maps to an entrant record, student signs up with code

All API requests include `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`. The requireAuth middleware validates the JWT via Supabase. The requireRole middleware checks user.role.

### Round Lifecycle State Machine

```
scheduled  >  open  >  closed  >  marking  >  results_released
```

- **scheduled:** Round created, opens_at is in the future. No access to papers.
- **open:** opens_at reached. Papers downloadable, submissions accepted, online sitting available.
- **closed:** closes_at reached. No more submissions. Papers locked.
- **marking:** Organiser triggers auto-mark. MCQ scored automatically; non-MCQ queued for human marking.
- **results_released:** Scores visible. Papers auto-archived. Qualified entrants identified.

Transitions from scheduled to open and open to closed are automatic, driven by a lifecycle service that queries rounds where the current time has passed the configured threshold.

### Auto-Marking Pipeline

1. Fetch all submissions with status=received for the round
2. For each submission, iterate over answers
3. MCQ answers: compare answer_value to correct_option, award max_points or 0
4. Non-MCQ answers: set submission status to queued_for_marking for human review
5. Update submission status to automarked or queued_for_marking

### Submission Idempotency

The composite unique constraint on (round_id, entrant_id, route) plus a unique idempotency_key ensures each submission is counted exactly once, even if the request is retried due to network issues.

## 6. Backlog Feature Design (Not Yet Implemented)

### Online Paper Sitting (Sprint 2)

Students sit papers in the browser with a server-authoritative timer. The remaining time is calculated from round.closes_at minus submission.received_at on the server, not a client-side countdown. This prevents timer manipulation via page refresh.

Answers are auto-saved on each change via debounced PATCH requests. On reconnection after a dropped connection, the frontend fetches the submission, pre-fills saved answers, and resumes the server-calculated timer.

The interface includes a question navigator showing answered, unanswered, and flagged questions, with Previous/Next navigation and a flag-for-review toggle.

### Notification System (Sprint 2)

Organisers configure notification rules with three components: trigger (e.g., "round opens in 24h"), recipient (e.g., "all registered educators"), and channel (email). A scheduler checks upcoming events against configured rules and dispatches notifications.

Rules can be dry-run tested against a past round before activation.

### Human Marking Queue (Sprint 2-3)

Non-MCQ answers are queued with status=queued_for_marking. Markers see a queue sorted by round and question, award partial credit (0 to max_points), and progress through the queue. Moderators sample a percentage of each marker's work for consistency review.

### Progression and Standings (Sprint 2-3)

After results are generated, entrants whose total_points meet the qualifying_threshold are automatically registered for the next round (no manual re-registration). Standings are published at both individual and school level.

### Question Bank and Variants (Sprint 3)

A central question repository tagged by subject, difficulty, topic, and type. Papers can be generated from the bank with balanced difficulty. Variants give different entrants different question orders or equivalent questions, and marking uses each entrant's specific variant key.

Question difficulty is derived from actual performance data: difficulty = 1 - (average score / max points).

### Appeals Pipeline (Sprint 3)

Students request a remark, which creates an appeal assigned to a reviewer. If upheld, marks are adjusted, results recalculated, ranks recomputed, and qualification status rechecked automatically.

### Multi-Olympiad Support (Sprint 3)

A single organiser account manages multiple concurrent olympiads, each with its own timezone setting. The authoritative clock for deadline enforcement uses the olympiad's timezone. All olympiads share a single archive of past papers.

### Online/Offline Hybrid (Sprint 3)

The same paper is available both online (browser sitting) and offline (downloaded PDF administered on paper). Offline results are uploaded by the educator. Both routes merge into a single result set per entrant. If an entrant appears via both routes, the system flags it for organiser review.

### Audit Log and Replay (Sprint 3)

Every automatic action (round transitions, auto-marking, progression, notifications) is logged with timestamp, action type, actor, and details. Given a round_id, the full event history can be replayed for dispute investigation.

              |
              +---> Supabase ---> PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage
```

Environment variables are managed per environment:

- Backend: DATABASE_URL, SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY, ORGANISER_SECRET, FRONTEND_URL
- Frontend: VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
