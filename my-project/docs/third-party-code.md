# Third-Party Code Documentation

> **Purpose:** Describe the external software and services used by the project, why they were chosen, and where they are used.

## Scope

This document covers the direct dependencies listed in `backend/package.json` and
`frontend/package.json`, together with the external services used by the
deployed application.

The project uses a hand-written API for its main application features. Supabase
provides authentication and file storage, while application data and competition
rules are handled through the Express API and Prisma services.

## Backend Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Use in this project | Selection rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `express` | Runtime | HTTP server, middleware, routes, and API responses in `backend/src/app.js` and `backend/src/routes` | Lightweight and provides direct control over the hand-written REST API. |
| `@prisma/client` | Runtime | Database queries and transactions in `backend/src/config/database.ts` and `backend/src/services` | Provides a generated database client, relational queries, and transaction support for submissions and marking. |
| `prisma` | Development | Schema generation, migrations, and database tooling | Keeps database structure version-controlled through `backend/prisma/schema.prisma` and migration files. |
| `@prisma/adapter-pg` | Runtime | Connects Prisma 7 to the PostgreSQL driver | Connects Prisma to the PostgreSQL driver used by the backend. |
| `pg` | Runtime | PostgreSQL connection pooling | Provides the database connection pool used by the Prisma adapter. |
| `@supabase/supabase-js` | Runtime | Verifies bearer tokens and creates signed storage URLs in `config/supabase.js`, `middlewares/auth.js`, and `services/paperService.js` | Uses an established identity and storage provider instead of implementing custom password hashing or JWT verification. |
| `helmet` | Runtime | Security headers in `backend/src/app.js` | Adds standard HTTP hardening with minimal application code. |
| `cors` | Runtime | Restricts browser origins in `backend/src/app.js` | Allows the separately deployed frontend to call the API while limiting unapproved origins. |
| `express-validator` | Runtime | Validates request bodies and route parameters in `backend/src/routes` | Checks input before it reaches the service layer and database. |
| `dotenv` | Runtime | Loads environment configuration in `backend/src/config/env.js` | Keeps credentials and deployment-specific values outside source code. |
| `multer` | Runtime | Receives multipart paper and memo uploads | Provides Express-compatible multipart parsing before files are sent to Supabase Storage. |
| `nodemailer` | Runtime | Sends school, educator, and student invitations in `backend/src/lib/mailer.ts` | Supports standard SMTP providers without coupling the application to one email vendor. |
| `tsx` | Runtime/tooling | Runs the mixed TypeScript/JavaScript backend and development watcher | Allows the backend to run TypeScript directly without a separate build step. |
| `typescript` | Tooling | Type-checks TypeScript files and supports editor tooling | Adds compile-time checks to the TypeScript portions of the backend. |
| `ws` | Runtime | Supplies the WebSocket implementation configured for the Supabase Node client | Makes the Supabase client usable in the Node.js server environment. |
| `@types/express`, `@types/node`, `@types/pg`, `@types/cors`, `@types/nodemailer` | Tooling | Type declarations for JavaScript libraries and Node APIs | Provides type information for the TypeScript parts of the backend. |

### Backend integration notes

- Express routes call controllers, and controllers pass application logic to services.
- Prisma is used to access the data for users, schools, olympiads, rounds,
  questions, submissions, answers, and results.
- Supabase Auth handles credentials and token verification. The local
  `users` table stores application roles and relationships.
- Supabase Storage stores paper and memo files. The database stores their object
  paths rather than the files themselves.
- Nodemailer sends invitation messages through configured SMTP credentials. In
  development, the mailer logs invitation details when SMTP is not configured.

## Frontend Dependencies

| Dependency | Type | Use in this project | Selection rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `react` | Runtime | Components and pages under `frontend/src` | Supports reusable interfaces for organiser, educator, and student workflows. |
| `react-dom` | Runtime | Mounts the React application in `frontend/src/main.tsx` | Standard browser renderer for React. |
| `react-router-dom` | Runtime | Client-side routes, route parameters, links, and navigation in `frontend/src/App.tsx` | Provides navigation between pages without full page reloads. |
| `@tanstack/react-query` | Runtime | Query client and educator data hooks | Helps load, cache, refresh, and update data from the API. |
| `@supabase/supabase-js` | Runtime | Browser sign-in and Supabase session access in `frontend/src/lib/supabase.ts` and auth pages | Reuses the same established identity provider as the backend. |
| `lucide-react` | Runtime | Icons in navigation, forms, exam controls, and status interfaces | Provides a consistent icon set as importable React components. |
| `vite` | Development | Development server and production bundling | Fast development feedback and a simple static build suitable for Vercel. |
| `@vitejs/plugin-react` | Development | React support for Vite | Connects React and JSX/TSX processing to the Vite build. |
| `typescript` | Development | Frontend type checking during `npm run build` | Detects type errors before the static bundle is produced. |
| `oxlint` | Development | Frontend linting through `npm run lint` | Provides fast static analysis for common code-quality issues. |
| `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`, `@types/node` | Development | Type declarations for React, the DOM, and Node tooling | Supports TypeScript checking and editor assistance. |

### Frontend integration notes

- `frontend/src/lib/api.ts` is the HTTP client used by pages and hooks. It
  attaches the stored Supabase access token to API requests.
- React Router controls page navigation. Backend middleware checks API
  authorization; the frontend currently relies on the API for access control.
- React Query is configured in `frontend/src/main.tsx` and used by selected
  educator data hooks. Many pages still use direct API calls.
- Vite produces the static frontend bundle used by the deployment platform.

## External Services And Infrastructure

| Service or tool | Integration | Why it is used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Supabase Auth | User registration, sign-in, access tokens, and account deletion | Satisfies the requirement to use an established authentication system. |
| Supabase PostgreSQL | Persistent relational data accessed through Prisma | Provides managed PostgreSQL while preserving a hand-written API boundary. |
| Supabase Storage | Private `papers` bucket and time-limited signed URLs | Stores large exam documents separately from relational records. |
| SMTP provider | Invitation email delivery through Nodemailer | Allows invitations to reach schools, educators, and students. |
| Docker `node:22-bookworm-slim` | Production backend image in `backend/Dockerfile` | Provides a reproducible Node.js runtime with the libraries required by the backend. |
| Render | Intended backend hosting target documented by the Dockerfile | Runs the containerized Express API and migration command. |
| Vercel | Intended frontend hosting target documented in the frontend deployment configuration | Serves the Vite-generated static SPA. |
| Gitea Actions | Repository automation configuration under `.gitea` | Automates backend image builds and deployment workflows. |

## Selection Decisions

The rationale for each major technology choice — Supabase for auth/storage, Prisma as the ORM, Express as the backend framework, and Vite for the frontend build — is covered in depth in [Data and Storage](data-storage.md), [Backend](backend.md), and [Frontend](frontend.md), rather than repeated here.

## Licensing

The project uses open-source packages. The main licenses used by these
packages are MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, and ISC.

The package versions and their license information are recorded in the package
manifests and lockfiles.
